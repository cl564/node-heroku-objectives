Objective 1 - Create a Node.js Hello World app hosted on Heroku and Submit a Pull Request
====================================

Your objective is to create a Hello World application deployed hosted on Heroku and to submit a pull request to this repository under the objective 1 folder with a title of your choosing.

**View an example:**
* Project: https://github.com/calvinbushor/node-heroku-objectives/tree/master/Objective%201%20-%20Hello%20World/HW-Example
* Hosted App: https://obscure-taiga-6718.herokuapp.com/


Things you will learn on this quest:

* How to create a GitHub account
* How to fork a repository
* How to install Node.js
* How to install Heroku developer kit
* How to install express using NPM.
* How to create a Node.js application
* How to run a Node.js express application locally
* How to write MarkDown
* How to commit changes using GIT
* How to submit a pull request
* How to deploy your application onto Heroku


### Step 1 - Create A GitHub Account
Go here: https://github.com/join

**Learn some GIT:**
* https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
* https://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/

### Step 2 - Learn how to fork this repo!
Learn here: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

### Step 3 - Install Node.js
Download here: https://nodejs.org/

### Step 4 - Setup Heroku

### Step 5 - Create your app and run it locally
Create an application with the following requirements:

* One main file to be run as your application. At a minimum, you application needs to emit "Hello World" to the screen.
* A package.json file to describe your application. (look at mine as an example)
* A README.md file describing your application.

**Install Dependencies:**
* The app that we are writing has dependencies on two external modules, express and ejs.
* To install these modules, we can choose one of two methods.

Method 1:
* In the package.json file, find the 'dependencies' section. Add the modules that your app uses to this section.
* After all dependencies have been added, navigate to the root directory of your app.
* Run the command 'npm install'.
* This is the technique used in the example app. Take a look at the package.json file there for reference.

Method 2:
* Go into your application root directory and run these commands:
* npm install express --save
* npm install ejs --save

### Step 6 - Commit your changes locally and upload to your forked version in your GitHub account
Commit early and often! With GIT, you have a local repository you will commit to and then you need to push changes up to your remote repository. If you want your changes up in your fork, make sure to do something like 'git push origin master' **but make sure this is correct for you**

A general rule of thumb is, once you complete a thought, commit! This will save you in the future... I promise.

### Step 7 - Get your app deployed on Heroku
What is Heroku: https://www.heroku.com/

See step 4 to get your app on Heroku.

### Step 8 - Update your README.md
I want to know about your app and so does everyone else. Your README.md is the entry point into your codebase so learn you some markdown to describe what you did.

### Step 9 - Submit me a pull request
Learn here: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

Submit a pull request with the following requirements:
* In the root of Objective 1, there should be a new folder with your apps name as the folder name. It cannot be the name of anyone else's submission.
* See Step 5 for other requirements.

### Step 10 - Let me know you are done
I did not have a step 10... but I really wanted a 10th step.

Enjoy!
